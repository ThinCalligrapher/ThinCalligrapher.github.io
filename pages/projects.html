            <p>
                I have been involved in many things in my time at University,
                and there are a few things that I am truly proud of. First, obviously, is this
                website. But the biggest project that I have taken part of is the CMS reserach lab,
                led by Dr. Usai and Dr. Gleyzer.

                The <strong>CMS</strong> (Compact Muon Solenoid) is a detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
                This detector is responsible for the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, which may help us 
                explain gravity. It is one of many detectors at CERN, and there is somewhat of a rivalry
                between them. CMS is currently undergoing a multi-year major upgrade. This will be completed in 2029.
                But right now, there are in the prototyping and development stage of new detectors. These
                detectors will be composed of tens of thousands of hexaboards.
            </p>
            <div id="paragraph_spacer"></div>
            <p>
                <em>What is a hexaboard?</em> I am glad you asked! A hexaboard is an approximately 20cm wide
                hexagonal circuit board. These boards will be arranged in cassetes. These cassets will be triangle shaped,
                and approximately 10 feet tall. These triangles will be positioned 360 degrees around the collider to
                detect muons. Our lab is responsible for testing some of the hexaboards, which is an intensive process.
            </p>
            <div id="paragraph_spacer"></div>
            <p>
                Testing these boards consists of a 1kV high voltage test, freezing them to -40 degrees C, and 
                a flatness test. Our lab will be responsible for a few thousand of these. I arrived at the lab when
                we only had 3 of them, so we had to develop our battery of tests on limited information, and 
                without a standardized process. The problems I have helped solve are:
            </p>
            <ul id="problems">
                <li class="prob">Fixing python package errors</li>
                <li class="prob">Debugging issues with a CERN developed Linux Distro</li>
                <li class="prob">Developing and testing a dry air system to reach a dewpoint of -60 degrees C</li>
                <li class="prob">Developing Python scripts to analyze jagged JSONs</li>
                <li class="prob"><strong>And so much more!</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <div id="paragraph_spacer"></div>
            <p>
                After months of hard work, being consistent, and proving myself I was officially promoted to <em>Head of Engineering</em>
                This was a teremendous feat for me, and something I am extremely proud of. But the lab has had many more benefits beyond my position!

            <h4 class="sub-subheading">Developing and Dockerizing a Model</h4>
            <div id="paragraph_spacer"></div>
            <p>
                A major part of the lab are the PhD students. They are mainly responsible for analyzing the 
                data that comes from the CMS. And something that was extremely enlightening to me was how 
                <strong>machine learning</strong> has changed the world of particle physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The CMS creates petabytes of data per second. It's too much data if everyone in the world was working at CERN.
                But machine learning can recognize patterns, spot new ones, and detect particles much faster than the most seasoned
                physicists. I have spent countless hours in the lab, and in this time I became very interested in the work of the data scientists
                who analyze the data from the CMS under Dr. Usai. This inspired my to make my own rudimentary model, and solve some problems.
            </p>
            <div id="paragraph_spacer"></div>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/ThinCalligrapher/mnist-docker" target="_blank">Here</a> is my model on GitHub. If you want to run it, follow the instructions in the readme!
            </p>
            <div id="paragraph_spacer"></div>
            <p>
                My model uses a simple feedforward neural network to identify numbers 0-9.
                With limited training, it is capable of over 97% accuracy. Building it has taught me so much
                about PyTorch, the math behind machine learning, data science, and graphing data. But I incorporated one
                more skill I have into this model
            </p>
            <div id="paragraph_spacer"></div>
            <p>
                <strong>Dockerizing the model.</strong> The lab has a computing cluster consisting of 3 A100 GPUs and 2 FPGAs
                inside of a 9 server cluster. This cluster is used by the data sciencists to run and train models. There are other elements of machine
                learning being used in the lab as well for visual inspection, which I am continuing to play a major role in.
                But I was immediately interested in the cluster when I arrived in the lab and I have been training on administering access to
                other students. Part of my training was learning how to use Docker, which containerizes applications to be used 
                by anyone anywhere.
            </p>
            <div id="paragraph_spacer"></div>
            <p>
                I have containerized my model, so that anyone with any version of Python can run my model without any dependecy issues. 
                Docker is quickly becoming the main method of distributed software development and deployment, as many companies use Docker to
                create containers that run the client experience of an application, and stay on the same page
                across multiple developer machines.
