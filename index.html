            Hello! My name is Chad Leino, and I am a Senior at the University of Alabama studying <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>.
            You may be wondering, why is a Computer Engineering student making their own website? Well it's because I love to 
            make things. Every time I see something interesting I say to myself "I wonder how they made that". And it turns out, websites
            can be pretty simple, so here we are.
            </p>

            Feel free to look around my website. It's pretty basic as I am still in the begenning of my web development jouney. I have
            learned all of this from the Odin Project. I heard about the Odin Project from my friend Naeem. He graduated from the 
            University of Auburn a few years ago with a Computer Science degree. But even after graduating, he had a hard time getting the kinds
            of positions he wanted. In his free time, he completed Odin, which is a full stack web development course. It's completely free and open
            source. I hope to complete the Odin Project by the time I graduate. But between my classes it can be hard to find the time.
            </p>

            If you have any questions, or want to hire me, please reach out! I am currently looking for an internship or a Co-Op position. My
            main focus is on hardware, machine learning, and in general software development. I honestly have too many interests right now!
